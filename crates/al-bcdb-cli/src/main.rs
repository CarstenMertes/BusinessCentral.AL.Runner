//! `al-bcdb`: the bcdb read commands over the `al-bcdb` core. This is the one place that
//! touches the OS (ADR-006): it maps the file and hands the core a byte source.
//!
//! Output is byte-for-byte what the published bcdb prints for the same command and file
//! (the differential tests in `tests/differential.rs` hold it to that), except where this
//! header says otherwise:
//!  * `tables` sorts ordinally; bcdb sorts with the current culture.
//!  * `--prefetch` is accepted and does nothing: the file is memory-mapped.
//!  * `restore` is not ported: it needs a SQL Server as destination.
//!  * `export` is new.
